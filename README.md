## What is a mod manager?
It's quite simple really, a mod manager is an application to make it easier to control which mods you have installed.

You can choose to update, enable/disable or even uninstall mods with a simple click, all whilst keeping it available on another profile.

## Installing

### First time installing
#### Windows
1. Click "Manual Download" on Thunderstore.
2. Inside the downloaded **.zip** file. Run the "r2modman Setup X.X.X.exe" (where X.X.X is the current version).
3. Follow the steps in the installer.

#### Linux
1. Click "Manual Download" on Thunderstore.
2. Inside the download **.zip** file there is an AppImage release.

**If you'd prefer to install platform specific builds then you can find them under the latest GitHub release on the ebkr/r2modmanPlus repository**

**Platform builds:**
 - deb
 - rpm
 - pacman
 - tar.gz

 _Problems with Linux builds should be reported in the [r2modman discord](https://discord.gg/jE2zWHY)._

### Updating
r2modman will automatically download any available updates whilst you use it.

If an update has been downloaded, it will be installed once you have closed the application.

## Feedback and suggestions
It's encouraged to provide as much feedback as you'd like, and fully open to criticism.

Suggestions are welcome and there are already some suggestions that have made it in to the manager!
From small features such as always-expanded cards, all the way to larger features such as code-based profile exports.

The only thing you have to consider when suggesting a feature is the impact it will have on users who don't have a lot of experience with computers.
